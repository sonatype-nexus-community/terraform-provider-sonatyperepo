```terraform
# Creating a Local User
resource "sonatyperepo_user" "test_user" {
  user_id       = "test-local-user"
  first_name    = "Testing"
  last_name     = "User"

  password      = "somethingSecurer"

# Defining a LDAP/CROWD/SAML User to bring into Terraform State
#
# See Import below also.
resource "sonatyperepo_user" "saml_admin" {
  # Local Roles can be assigned and managed for non-local users
  roles = ["nx-test-role"]

  # These fields cannot be managed by Terraform - they are readonly for non-local Users
  user_id       = "admin"
  email_address = "admin@somewhere.tld"
  first_name    = "SAML"
  last_name     = "Admin"
