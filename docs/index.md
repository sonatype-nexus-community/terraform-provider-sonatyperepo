# Sonatype Nexus Repository Provider

The `sonatyperepo` provider is used to interact with resources supported by [Sonatype Nexus Repository](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-nexus-repository). 

The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Compatability

This Provider is tested on Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager versions `3.79.1` through `3.87.0` currently.

Sonatype Nexus Repository must not be in read-only mode in order to use this Provider. This will be checked. 
		
Some resources and features depend on the version of Sonatype Nexus Repository you are running. See individual Data Source and Resource documentaiton for details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Simplest Configuration
provider "sonatyperepo" {
  host     = "https://my-sonatype-nexus-repository.tld:port"
  username = "username"
  password = "password"
}

# If you run with a base path, you can add it:
provider "sonatyperepo" {
  host          = "https://my-sonatype-nexus-repository.tld:port"
  username      = "username"
  password      = "password"
  api_base_path = "/my-custom-base/service/rest"
}

# If you access via a Load Balancer or service that strips the `Server` header
# you can provide a hint as to the version of Sonatype Nexus Repository:
provider "sonatyperepo" {
  host         = "https://my-sonatype-nexus-repository.tld:port"
  username     = "username"
  password     = "password"
  version_hint = "3.85.0-03 (PRO)"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for your user for Sonatype Nexus Repository Server
- `url` (String) Sonatype Nexus Repository Server URL
- `username` (String) Username for Sonatype Nexus Repository Server, requires role/permissions scoped to the resources you wish to manage

### Optional

- `api_base_path` (String) Base Path at which the API is present - defaults to `/service/rest`. This only needs to be set if you run Sonatype Nexus Repository at a Base Path that is not `/`.
- `version_hint` (String) You can set this to the full version string (e.g. "3.85.0-03 (PRO)" or "3.80.0-06 (OSS)") of Sonatype Nexus Repository that you are connecting to.

> [!NOTE] 
> You can find the full version string in _Admin -> Support -> System Information_.
>				
> By default, this provider will attempt to automatically determine the version of Sonatype Nexus Repository you are connected to - but in some 
> real world cases, a Load Balancer or such may strip the HTTP Header that contians this information (the _Server_ header).

> [!TIP]
> If you receive an error such as `Plan is not supported for Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager: 0.0.0-0 (PRO=false)` then you should set 
> this attribute - otherwise, do not supply this attribute.
