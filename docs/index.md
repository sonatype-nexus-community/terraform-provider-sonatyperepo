# Sonatype Nexus Repository Provider

The `sonatyperepo` provider is used to interact with resources supported by [Sonatype Nexus Repository](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-nexus-repository). 

The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Sonatype Nexus Repository must not be in read-only mode in order to use this Provider. This will be checked. 
		
Some resources and features depend on the version of Sonatype Nexus Repository you are running. See individual Data Source and Resource documentaiton for details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "sonatyperepo" {
  host     = "https://my-sonatype-nexus-repository.tld:port"
  username = "username"
  password = "password"
}
```
